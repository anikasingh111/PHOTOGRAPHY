<h1>Anika's <em>Photogenic World</em></h1>
<p>Getting to know me!</p>Hello Readers. My name is Anika Singh. I had keen interest in photography from a very young age. I started to include myself into object photography when I came to Canada in December 2022.
My photography collection kept on increasing day by day therefore, I categorized my artworks into 3 categories i.e Nature photography, Architecture Photography and Sketchworks.
The Sketchworks that I have included in my webpage are self-made. I would love to make you walk through my art and photography. Hope you would enjoy seeing my artworks.

  <dd>Below are some of my works that I captured using <strong>iphone13's camera.</strong> My college friends still gets amazed by the fact that how do I manage to get such clicks without using a
  photography specified camera such as Canon and Nikon.</dd>

  <dt><h3>Architecture</h3></dt>
  <p></p>
  <dd>You know you have developed an amazing taste in photography when you can edit a simple lamp to give ancient architecture vibes. I also love to explore the streets of <strong>Ottawa's downtown.</strong></dd>

  <dt><h4>Sketchworks</h4></dt>
    <p></p>
  <dd>Whenever I start sketching, I get that nostalgic feeling of my childhood! Getting inspired from different television shows, I started sketching my favourite characters.
    The continuous practice helped me improve my bold outlinings</dd>
